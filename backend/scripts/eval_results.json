Tell the landlord\u2014 in writing\u2014 that the report violates state law and demand that it be withdrawn.

Send the landlord a dated, written demand that they immediately withdraw the report and give you written confirmation. Cite the statute above.\n2. Dispute the item with the credit bureau(s) in writing and attach a copy of the statute and your letter to the landlord.\n3. If the item isn\u2019t deleted within 30 days, you can sue the landlord for any actual damages plus your attorney fees (ORS 90.255). Small-claims court is an option.\n\nIf you need free legal help, call the Oregon Law Center: 1-800-673-0506.\n",
